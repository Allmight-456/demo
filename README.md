## DEMO
This is a mark down language Readme file.
Now for some more versions of the previous demo commit
changed the spelling a bit . now for the 3rd commit

A lot of troubleshooting went into adding a file to this existing repository(i.e. demo.txt) . 
errors include rejecting push requests and unable to merge 
Used commands such as 
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main                                                    -Refused to merge
git merge origin/main --allow--unrelated--histories
git push -u origin main
